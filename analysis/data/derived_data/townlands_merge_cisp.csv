In OI, 58, Ferguson speaks of ""the singularly Patrician character of its local surroundings"", given that Foghill is ""the site of the wood of Focluth"", in the ""immediate vicinity is Rathban, a residence of that Auley son of Fiachra, the contemporary of Patrick, from whom the barony takes its name"", and ""Fiersad Tresi, in which Tresi wife of Auley was drowned"", etc.
Ferguson points to the fact that Rathfran ""was undoubtedly a residence of Amalgaid, or Awley, the cotemporary of Patrick, from whom the barony takes its name, and in Foghill we probably have some trace, in its northern limits, of that wood of Fochlaidh, celebrated in all lives of the saint"".

It commands a wide view of the surrounding countryside and comprises a subrectangular burial area, located towards the N end of a possible early enclosure. Standing within the burial area is a cross-slab and an ogham stone.  Skinner records that rounds were formerly performed at the site on Good Fridays...

`The subrectangular burial area, raised .5m above external ground level at S, measures 21.7m NW--SE x 15.5m NE--SW.  It is located in the E corner of a modern field and is bounded at N and E by field walls.  It is delimited elsewhere by a stony bank.  Planted with spruce trees, the interior contains about thirty small, upright slabs, the majority occur in  regular rows.  These slabs presumably relate to the use of the site as a _ceall˙nach_, which continued until the beginning of the twentieth century (local information).

`Approximately 30m NW of the burial ground is a curving stretch of stony bank with an external fosse.  It may have formed part of an early enclosure.  Adjacent to its inner face at W are a number of small, angular stretches of banks, and the foundations of a large rectangular building measuring 15.8m NE--SW and 11.2m NW--SE.'
